## Climes React-native widget component

- See `App.js` for basic implementation(without API call)

- Check for file named `WidgetComponent.js` for react-native opt-in widget.
  Widget takes two props -

  ```
  truecostValue: pass on the truecost value from truecost api call response,
  onOptInChange: callback to take action on opt-in checkbox state change
  ```

- Component uses `@react-native-community/checkbox` as the default checkbox, please change as required

- Component uses inline styles, please change as required
